# episcanpy-paper

EpiScanpy (Epigenomics single cell analysis in python) is a toolkit to analyse single-cell open chromatin (scATAC-seq) and single-cell DNA methylation (for example scBS-seq) data. EpiScanpy is the epigenomic extension of the very popular scRNA-seq analysis tool Scanpy (Genome Biology, 2018) [Wolf18]. For more information, read epiScanpy and scanpy documentation.

The documentation for epiScanpy is available here. If epiScanpy is useful to your research, consider citing epiScanpy.

This specific repository gather scripts used for the benchamrking of epiScanpy to other scATACseq dataprocessign methods using https://github.com/pinellolab/scATAC-benchmarking implementation (Huidong Chen, Caleb Lareau, Tommaso Andreani, Michael E. Vinyard, Sara P. Garcia, Kendell Clement, Miguel A. Andrade-Navarro, Jason D. Buenrostro & Luca Pinello. Assessment of computational methods for the analysis of single-cell ATAC-seq data.
