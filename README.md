# episcanpy-paper

**EpiScanpy** (Epigenomics single cell analysis in python) is a toolkit to analyse single-cell open chromatin (scATAC-seq) and single-cell DNA methylation (for example scBS-seq) data. **EpiScanpy** is the epigenomic extension of the very popular scRNA-seq analysis tool **Scanpy** (`Genome Biology <https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-017-1382-0>`__, 2018) [Wolf18]. For more information, read scanpy `documentation <https://scanpy.readthedocs.io>`__. 


The documentation for epiScanpy is available `here <https://episcanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. If epiScanpy is useful to your research, consider citing `epiScanpy <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/648097v1>`__.


This specific repository gather scripts used for the benchamrking of epiScanpy to other scATACseq dataprocessign methods using https://github.com/pinellolab/scATAC-benchmarking implementation (Huidong Chen, Caleb Lareau, Tommaso Andreani, Michael E. Vinyard, Sara P. Garcia, Kendell Clement, Miguel A. Andrade-Navarro, Jason D. Buenrostro & Luca Pinello. Assessment of computational methods for the analysis of single-cell ATAC-seq data. Genome Biology 20, 241 (2019).)

Due to the large size of the data, they are not directly available on Github. Just send an email to anna.danese@helmholtz-muenchen.de and we will make them available.
