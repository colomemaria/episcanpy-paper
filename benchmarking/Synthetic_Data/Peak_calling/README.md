# Simulate peak calling with rare populations

The *code* subfolder provides an ordered execution of scripts needed to call peaks
using input bam files 

The first 3 scripts (01, 02, and 02a) require large input files that are only available 
on the author's local hard disk. 

Script 03 is used to generate the plot in the paper and all requisite input files (the output
of 02a) are available in the *peak_calls* folder.

The design of the simulation can be found in the file *data/simulation_1_design.tsv*.
